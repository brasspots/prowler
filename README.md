# Prowler (2.3)
An unpacked chrome extension to search pages for words in a blacklist and alert the user if any of them are found.
The user can then choose to continue, redact or go back:
 - Continuing will make no changes to the page
 - Redacting will block out all words that are in the black list as well as any images
 - Going back will... well, go back

Additionally, the user can specify certain URLs not to scan in files/exceptions.csv, each entry must be seperated by a single comma. The user can also change the blacklist at files/words.csv in the same way. To popup in the top right corner can also be used to fine tune how Prowler works.
